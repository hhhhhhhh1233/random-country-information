# random-country-information
A program meant to run on an Arduino for a school project

When the button is pressed, the program will flash all 20 LEDs once and then finally stop at one of them. Each LED represents a country, so the you'll also get a fact about the country that you land on. The facts are meant to be displayed on a 16x2 LCD display and spoken through TTS.
